Thoughts on dungeon generation:

Level is split up into a grid

- Small (3x3 - 6x6)
- Medium (7x7 - 10x10)
- Large (11x11 - 20x20)
- Mega (> 21x21)

When generating, loop through each grid cell and determine:

- Has a room center?
- Type of room?
- Size of room?

- Build room.

From this, we can calculate the size of VoxelVolume we need to hold
the level, build it, hollow it out and go.

Each block is 32x32 voxels
Each room is a region
Tunnels will span regions

Scene Manager setup:

- Each room becomes a Zone 
- Each tunnel becomes a Zone
- Portals placed at doors between tunnels and rooms

Need to support overlapping rooms?

Tunnelling?

- Graph theory on connectivity, this is next

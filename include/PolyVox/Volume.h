	///The Volume class provides a memory efficient method of storing voxel data while also allowing fast access and modification.
	////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
	/// A Volume is essentially a '3D image' in which each element (voxel) is identified
	/// by a three dimensional (x,y,z) coordinate, rather than the two dimensional (x,y)
	/// coordinate which is used to identify an element (pixel) in a normal image. Within
	/// PolyVox, the Volume class is used to store and manipulate our data before we extract 
	/// our SurfaceMeshs from it.
	/// 
	/// <b>Data Representaion - feel free to skip</b>
	/// If stored carelessly, volume data can take up a huge amount of memory. For example, a
	/// volume of dimensions 1024x1024x1024 with 1 byte per voxel will require 1GB of memory
	/// if stored in an uncompressed form. Natuarally our Volume class is much more efficient
	/// than this and it is worth understanding (at least at a high level) the approach
	/// which is used.
	/// 
	/// Essentially, the Volume class stores its data as a collection of blocks. Each 
	/// of these block is much smaller than the whole volume, for example a typical size
	/// might be 32x32x32 voxels (though is is configurable by the user). In this case,
	/// a 256x512x1024 volume would contain 8x16x32 = 4096 blocks. However, it is unlikely that
	/// all these blocks actually have to be stored because usually there are duplicates
	/// in which case common data can be shared.
	/// 
	/// Identifying duplicate blocks is in general a difficult task which involves looking at pairs
	/// of blocks and comparing all the voxels. This is a time consuming task which is not amiable 
	/// to being performed when the volume is being modified in real time. However, there are two
	/// specific scenarios which are easily spotted and which PolyVox uses to identify block
	/// sharing opportunities.
	/// 
	/// -# Homogeneous blocks (those which contain just a single voxel value) are easy to
	/// spot and fairly common becuase volumes often contain large homogeous regions. Any time
	/// you change the value of a voxel you have potentially made the block which contains
	/// it homogeneous. PolyVox does not check the homogeneity immediately as this would slow
	/// down the process of modifying voxels, but you can use the tidyUpMemory() function
	/// to check for and remove duplicate homogeneous regions whenever you have spare
	/// processing time.
	/// 
	/// -# Copying a volume naturally means that all the voxels in the second volume are
	/// the same as the first. Therefore volume copying is a relatively fast operation in
	/// which all the blocks in the second volume simply reference the first volume. Future
	/// modifications to either volume will, of course, cause the blocks to become unshared.
	/// 
	/// Other advantages of breaking the volume down into blocks include enhancing data locality
	/// (i.e. voxels which are spatially near to each other are also likely to be near in
	/// memory) and the ability to load larger volumes as no large contiguous areas of
	/// memory are needed. However, these advantages are more transparent to user code
	/// so we will not dwell on them here.
	/// 
	/// <b>Usage</b>
	/// Volumes are constructed by passing the desired width, height and depth to the
	/// constructor. Note that for speed reasons only values which are a power of two
	/// are permitted for these sidelengths.
	/// 
	/// \code
	/// Volume<uint8_t> volData(g_uVolumeSideLength, g_uVolumeSideLength, g_uVolumeSideLength);
	/// \endcode
	/// 
	/// Access to specific voxels is provided by the getVoxelAt() and setVoxelAt() fuctions.
	/// Each of these has two forms so that voxels can be identified by integer triples
	/// or by Vector3DUint16%s.
	/// 
	/// \code
	/// volData.setVoxelAt(12, 186, 281, 3);
	/// uint8_t voxelValue = volData.getVoxelAt(12, 186, 281);
	/// //voxelValue is now 3
	/// \endcode
	/// 
	/// The tidyUpMemory() function should normally be called after you first populate
	/// the volume with data, and then at periodic intervals as the volume is modified.
	/// However, you don't actually <i>have</i> to call it at all. See the function's
	/// documentation for further details.
	/// 
	/// One further important point of note is that this class is templatised on the voxel
	/// type. This allows you to store volumes of data types you might not normally expect,
	/// for example the OpenGL example 'abuses' this class to store a 3D grid of pointers.
	/// However, it is not guaranteed that all functionality works correctly with non-integer
	/// voxel types.
